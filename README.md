This is an Independent Component Analysis python program designed by a team of computer science students. Corey Warren was put in charge of the code.
The essay details the mathematics and science behind the procedures, and the code is well-documented and commented all throughout.

# What is ICA?
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) involves breaking a mixed signal into separate, distinct signals. The use case of ICA pertains to the concept of having, for example, a conversation recorded, but having multiple signals mixed as one. ICA can potentially separate those signals back into their original, distinct forms, even after being mixed into a single signal.
